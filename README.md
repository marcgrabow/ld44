The source code in this repository is for demonstration only - it will not run as a full game in the Unity Editor. For my development I use a bunch of third-party assets that for licencing reasons I cannot include in the public repository. Contact me if you want to know which assets I used, you would have to purchase them in the asset store to get this game running on your machine.

Also, the source code is super dirty. There was literally 0% attention to code quality during the jam, as always. Quick & dirty always rulez during jams.
